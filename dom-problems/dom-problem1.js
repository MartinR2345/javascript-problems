//Step 1: Create a paragraph <p> tag and <button> tag in HTML file
//Step 2: Give <p> element an id name, (p1)
//Step 3: Give <button> tag an onclick event and name, which would be (changeColor)
//Step 4: In my Javascript file, write a function name (changeColor) and inside that block of code, I select my <p1> tag and set a style property to target the background color so when I click on the button it would change the background of the <p> tag to orange

function changeColor() {
    p1.style.backgroundColor = "orange";
}
