//Step 2: Write a function name checkItem and it has two parameters (obj) and (item) this function will check to see whether an object contains the specified key
//Step 3: I am going to return my first parameter (obj) that been assigned to hasOwnProperty method which holds my second parameter (item).  Basically this will return a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property
