//Step 1: Create a function name removeDuplicates that takes one parameter, an array (arr)
//Step 2: Create an empty array use as a default reference
//Step 3: Use a for loop to loop through each and every element of my array
//Step 4: Create an if statement that will check if the specialArray includes or has that element or not. I would be using the includes() method. If not, then if the condition becomes true, then we push that element into the special array with the push() method
//Step 5: Return my specialArray variable
//Step 6: Print to the console the function removeDuplicates
