//Objective: Write a JavaScript function to calculate the factorial of a number.

//Step 1: Write a function name factorial that takes in one parameter name (num) and the goal is to calculate the factorial of a number.
//Step 2: I'm going to use an if statement to prevent infinite recursion and to check if my parameter (num) is equal to 0 then return 1.  If the (num) is positive or greater then the program will loop itself by decreasing the number until that number becomes 1.  When the number reaches 0, 1 is returned.
