//Objective: Write a JavaScriptÂ function to compute the sum of an array of integers.

//Step 1: Write a function name sumArray that takes in one parameter called (numbers).  This is actually holding my array value.
//Step 2: I create a variable name store and set it equal to zero(0).  This will store the sum of my array.
//Step 3: I used a for loop to loop through my numbers array individually  
//Step 4: Return my (sum) variable once the loop is finished and print to the console my function sumArray
